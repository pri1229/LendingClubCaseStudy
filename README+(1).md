# Bike-Sharing Linear Regression Assignment
> The details of the problem statement is as follows :

  • A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to
    individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to
    borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the
    payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another
    dock belonging to the same system.

  • A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their
    revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to
    sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business
    plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end,
    and the economy restores to a healthy state

## General Information
- This Bike Sharing Assignment is solved to practice and apply Linear Regression algorithm as part of the machine learning program.
- We are trying to understand what are the paramters that affect the business of bike-sharing for boombikes in the US
- The business problem that we are trying to solve here is reinstating the business of boombikes after pandemic to be used as prior with        different strategies
- The dataset being used is day.csv

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0 - for coding purpose
- Git and Github - for pushing the code to the github platform
- Libraries used - numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

## Acknowledgements
- The problem statement was given by IIIT-Upgrad collaboration project
